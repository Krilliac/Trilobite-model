"""self_curriculum — trilobite invents its own grounded practice tasks.

The model is asked to emit a JSON object describing ONE new coding task
(name/prompt/check/reference). We parse it, validate it by actually
*running* the reference solution against its own check (grounding.run_code),
and require it be novel against the existing task pools. Everything here is
pure/injectable so it can be tested without a live model or GPU — the
controller (curriculum_run.py) wires in the real model.

Output a single JSON object with exactly these keys:
- "name": a snake_case Python function name for the task (e.g. "reverse_words").
- "prompt": a self-contained task description asking for that Python function, \
ending with the exact sentence "Return ONLY the function in one python code block."
- "check": Python code with 2 or more `assert` statements that exercise the \
function by name (referring to it as defined by "name") and would fail on a \
wrong or missing implementation.
- "reference": a correct Python implementation of the function described in "prompt".

Rules:
- The task must be genuinely different from common textbook exercises already seen \
(reverse a string, factorial, fizzbuzz, is_prime, etc.) — invent something novel.
- "reference" must actually satisfy "check" when run together.
- Output ONLY the JSON object. No prose, no markdown fences, no explanation before or after.
