"""difficulty_estimator — heuristic task-difficulty score in [0, 1].

trilobite's solver spends a FIXED repair budget (max_attempts) on every task,
whether it's "reverse a string" or "write a thread-safe LRU cache with a
custom eviction policy". That's wasted budget on the easy end and often not
enough on the hard end. This module scores a task's TEXT (no execution, no
model call) so callers can route effort BEFORE spending a single generation:
more solver.solve() attempts / best_of_n candidates for hard tasks, fewer for
easy ones — trading token budget in proportion to expected difficulty instead
of a flat guess.

Three deterministic signals combine into the score:
  - length      — longer specs tend to carry more hidden complexity
                  (saturating, so a 5000-word essay doesn't dominate)
  - keywords    — surface signals correlated with genuinely harder code:
                  recursion, dynamic programming, concurrency, parsing, regex
  - constraints — imperative/numeric requirements ("must", "at most N",
                  numbered lists, complexity bounds) — more constraints to
                  satisfy simultaneously means more ways to get it wrong

Pure and stdlib-only: one function of a string in, one float out (plus an
optional breakdown for logging/debugging). No GPU, no network, no subprocess.
