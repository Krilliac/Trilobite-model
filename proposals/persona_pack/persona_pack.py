"""persona_pack — a second, specialist-flavored persona set for trilobite.

`personas.py` ships a general-purpose set (coder / explainer / reviewer /
teacher). This module is an independent add-on pack aimed at the specific
jobs trilobite's solver/reflection loop already does — debugging a failing
run, auditing for security issues, and tightening a hot path — plus a
teacher persona tuned for line-by-line code walkthroughs rather than
general concepts.

Pure data + a pure lookup function. No I/O, no model calls, no dependency
on personas.py (so it composes with it rather than requiring an edit to
it): a caller that wants one merged registry can do
`{**personas.PERSONAS, **persona_pack.get_pack()}`.
