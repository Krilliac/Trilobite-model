"""self_eval_harness — regression-tracking eval log.

Runs a fixed set of held-out tasks through an INJECTED `solve_fn` (so the
caller decides how "solving" happens: a live model, solver.solve, a stub for
tests, whatever), computes a pass-rate, and appends one JSONL record per run
to a log file so pass-rate can be tracked over time (e.g. across trilobite
fine-tunes, prompt tweaks, or verifier changes) to catch regressions.

Deliberately dependency-free: no model/GPU calls happen here, and `ts` is
always passed in by the caller rather than read from the clock, so runs are
reproducible and easy to unit test.

Typical usage:

    import self_eval_harness as seh
    import training_tasks

    tasks = training_tasks.sample(20)
    record = seh.run_and_log(tasks, my_solve_fn, ts=time.time(),
                              log_path="eval_log.jsonl")
    print(record["pass_rate"])

    history = seh.load_log("eval_log.jsonl")
    if seh.regressed(history):
        print("pass-rate dropped vs best-so-far -- investigate before shipping")
