"""game_ladder — trilobite's "game gauntlet".

Escalating-difficulty ladder: for each level, trilobite generates a
complete, runnable game (code + procedurally-drawn assets), we ground it
by actually running it headless, and the ladder stops at the first level
that fails. Also feeds pass/fail back into trilobite's learning loop via
server.record_outcome, so the gauntlet doubles as training signal.

Stdlib only (+ py_compile/subprocess). No GPU/model calls at import time —
those only happen in the __main__ live driver.
